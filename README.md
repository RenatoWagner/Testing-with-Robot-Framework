# Testing-with-Robot-Framework
This is a test project that I made with Robot Framework.
I Just organized the files using some of Page Object pattern. That pattern is very helpful.

To do those tests I used a web page I found on the internet, enough to Create, Delete, Edit, View, List and others types of test case.

Here is the link to the web page:https://pdocrud.com/demo/pages/

It was a great challenge. I am running to do the same tests using another tool. When we know one functional testing tool, we can do with others. :)
